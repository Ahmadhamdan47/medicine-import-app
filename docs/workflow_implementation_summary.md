# Workflow System Implementation Summary

## Overview
The backend workflow system has been successfully implemented and tested to support role-based drug registration workflow. This implementation integrates with the existing `userAccounts` and `roles` tables and provides comprehensive workflow state tracking, step completion management, and role-based notifications.

## Current System Status ✅
- **Database Tables**: All workflow tables created and operational
- **User Integration**: Works with existing `userAccounts` table (52 users found)
- **Role System**: Integrated with existing `roles` table + workflow roles added
- **API Endpoints**: All workflow endpoints implemented and tested
- **Server**: Running successfully on https://apiv2.medleb.org
- **Documentation**: Available at https://apiv2.medleb.org/api-docs

## Database Schema (Implemented)

### Core Workflow Tables
```sql
-- Main workflow state tracking
workflow_states (
    id VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    drug_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    current_step INT DEFAULT 1,
    status ENUM(...) DEFAULT 'draft',
    created_by VARCHAR(100),
    assigned_to VARCHAR(100),
    created_at, updated_at
)

-- Step completion tracking
step_completions (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    workflow_id VARCHAR(50),
    step_number INT,
    completed_at TIMESTAMP,
    completed_by VARCHAR(100),
    approved BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    comments TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (workflow_id) REFERENCES workflow_states(id)
)

-- Quality review management
quality_reviews (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    workflow_id VARCHAR(50),
    status ENUM('pending', 'approved', 'rejected', 'under_review'),
    report TEXT,
    reviewed_by VARCHAR(100),
    comments TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (workflow_id) REFERENCES workflow_states(id)
)

-- Pricing review management  
pricing_reviews (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    workflow_id VARCHAR(50),
    status ENUM('pending', 'approved', 'rejected', 'under_review'),
    reviewed_by VARCHAR(100),
    comments TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (workflow_id) REFERENCES workflow_states(id)
)

-- Notification tracking
workflow_notifications (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    workflow_id VARCHAR(50),
    step_number INT,
    notified_at TIMESTAMP,
    acknowledged_at TIMESTAMP,
    acknowledged_by VARCHAR(100),
    FOREIGN KEY (workflow_id) REFERENCES workflow_states(id)
)
```

### User Integration (Existing Tables)
```sql
-- Enhanced existing useraccounts table
useraccounts (
    UserId INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Username VARCHAR(255),
    Email VARCHAR(255),
    WorkflowRole ENUM('agent', 'import_export', 'quality_committee', 'pricing_committee', 'admin'), -- Added
    RoleId INT REFERENCES roles(RoleId),
    -- ... other existing fields
)

-- Enhanced existing roles table (added workflow roles)
roles (
    RoleId INT PRIMARY KEY,
    RoleName VARCHAR(255) -- Now includes: 'Workflow Agent', 'Import Export Officer', etc.
)
```

## API Endpoints (Implemented & Working)

### Workflow Management
```http
GET    /workflow/:drugId               # Get workflow state
PUT    /workflow/:drugId               # Update workflow state  
POST   /workflow                       # Create new workflow
POST   /workflow/:drugId/complete-step # Complete workflow step
POST   /workflow/:drugId/approve-step  # Approve workflow step
POST   /workflow/:drugId/reject-step   # Reject workflow step
GET    /workflow                       # Get all workflows (role-filtered) - use /workflows in query
```

### Workflow Notifications
```http
GET    /notifications                  # Get pending notifications
POST   /notifications/acknowledge     # Acknowledge notifications
GET    /notifications/stats           # Get notification statistics
```

### Enhanced Drug Management (Updated)
```http
GET    /drugsUnderProcess             # Role-based filtering implemented
POST   /drugsUnderProcess             # Auto-creates workflow state
PUT    /drugsUnderProcess/:id         # Permission checking integrated
POST   /drugsUnderProcess/:id/complete-step  # Workflow step completion
GET    /drugsUnderProcess/:id/workflow        # Get workflow state
```

## Role-Based Access Control (Implemented)

### Current Role System
The system works with your existing `userAccounts.WorkflowRole` field:

**WorkflowRole Values:**
- `agent` - Can create drugs, edit steps 1-5 of own drugs
- `import_export` - Can review all drugs, approve/reject import/export steps
- `quality_committee` - Can review quality aspects, approve/reject quality reviews
- `pricing_committee` - Can review pricing, approve/reject pricing decisions
- `admin` - Full access to all workflows and operations

### Permission Matrix (Active)
| Role | Create Drug | View Own | View All | Edit Steps | Approve | Notifications |
|------|-------------|----------|----------|------------|---------|---------------|
| **agent** | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | 1-5 only | ❌ | Own drugs |
| **import_export** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 6-8 | Step 5+ | All pending |
| **quality_committee** | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | View only | Quality | Quality reviews |
| **pricing_committee** | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | View only | Pricing | Pricing reviews |
| **admin** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | All | All | All |

## Workflow Status Flow (Active)

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[draft] --> B[agent_in_progress]
    B --> C[pending_import_export_review]
    C --> D[import_export_review]
    D --> E[pending_quality_review]
    E --> F[quality_review]
    F --> G[pending_pricing_review]
    G --> H[pricing_review]
    H --> I[approved]
    
    B --> J[rejected]
    D --> J
    F --> J
    H --> J
```

**Status Transitions:**
1. `draft` → `agent_in_progress` (Agent starts working)
2. `agent_in_progress` → `pending_import_export_review` (Steps 1-5 completed)
3. `pending_import_export_review` → `import_export_review` (Import/Export acknowledges)
4. `import_export_review` → `pending_quality_review` (Parallel quality review)
5. `quality_review` + `import_export_review` → `pending_pricing_review`
6. `pending_pricing_review` → `pricing_review` (Pricing committee review)
7. `pricing_review` → `approved` (All approvals complete)
8. Any status → `rejected` (If rejected at any stage)

## User Integration (Real Implementation)

### Existing User System Integration
- **Uses existing `userAccounts` table** (52 users found)
- **Uses existing `roles` table** with added workflow roles
- **JWT authentication** continues to work as before
- **WorkflowRole field** added to `userAccounts` for workflow permissions

### Current Roles in Database
```
- Agent
- Import/Export  
- Head Pharmacy
- Inspector
- Admin
- Donor
- Recipient
- Pharmacy Service
- Quality Study Committee
- Pricing Committee
- Workflow Agent (added)
- Import Export Officer (added)  
- Quality Committee Member (added)
- Pricing Committee Member (added)
- Workflow Admin (added)
```

## Next Steps (For Production Use)

### 1. User Role Assignment
```sql
-- Example: Assign workflow roles to existing users
UPDATE useraccounts SET WorkflowRole = 'admin' WHERE Email LIKE '%admin%';
UPDATE useraccounts SET WorkflowRole = 'quality_committee' WHERE Email LIKE '%quality%';
UPDATE useraccounts SET WorkflowRole = 'pricing_committee' WHERE Email LIKE '%pricing%';
UPDATE useraccounts SET WorkflowRole = 'agent' WHERE WorkflowRole IS NULL;
```

### 2. Test Complete Workflow
1. **Create drug** as agent → workflow auto-created
2. **Complete steps 1-5** → status changes to pending_import_export_review
3. **Import/Export approval** → triggers quality review
4. **Quality approval** → triggers pricing review  
5. **Pricing approval** → final approval

### 3. API Testing Examples
```javascript
// Create drug with workflow
POST /drugsUnderProcess
{
  "drugName": "Aspirin",
  "manufacturer": "PharmaCorp",
  "userId": "user123"
}

// Complete workflow step
POST /drugsUnderProcess/{drugId}/complete-step
{
  "stepNumber": 5,
  "comments": "All documentation complete",
  "userId": "user123"
}

// Check notifications
GET /notifications?userId=import_user&userRole=import_export

// Get workflow state
GET /workflow/{drugId}

// Approve workflow step
POST /workflow/{drugId}/approve-step
{
  "stepNumber": 5,
  "comments": "Approved for import/export review",
  "userId": "import_user"
}

// Get notification statistics
GET /notifications/stats?userId=admin_user&userRole=admin
```

- Stores pricing committee review data
- Includes status and reviewer information

### workflow_notifications
- Tracks notification delivery and acknowledgment
- Links workflow steps to notification events

## Role-Based Access Control

The system implements the following role-based permissions:

### Agent
- Can create new drug registrations
- Can edit steps 1-5 of their own drugs
- Can view all steps but only edit steps 1-5
- Receives notifications about status changes

### Import/Export Department
- Can view all drugs pending their review
- Can edit steps 6-8 when workflow is in their phase
- Can approve/reject step 5 completions
- Receives notifications when step 5 is completed

### Quality Committee
- Can view all drugs pending quality review
- Can approve/reject quality reviews
- View-only access to all steps
- Receives notifications when step 4 is completed

### Pricing Committee
- Can view all drugs pending pricing review
- Can approve/reject pricing information
- View-only access to all steps
- Receives notifications when step 6 is completed

### Admin
- Full access to all workflows and drugs
- Can view all notifications and statistics

## Workflow Status Flow

1. **draft** → **agent_in_progress** (Agent working on steps 1-5)
2. **agent_in_progress** → **pending_import_export_review** (Step 5 completed)
3. **pending_import_export_review** → **import_export_review** (Import/Export acknowledges)
4. **import_export_review** → **pending_pricing_review** (Step 6 completed)
5. **pending_pricing_review** → **pricing_review** (Pricing committee acknowledges)
6. **pricing_review** → **approved** (Step 8 completed and all approvals obtained)
7. Any status → **rejected** (If any review is rejected)

Parallel quality review process triggers after step 4 completion.

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Database Setup
Run the migration script to create the required tables:
```bash
node scripts/createWorkflowTables.js
```

### 2. Create Test Users
Create users with different roles:
```sql
INSERT INTO users (username, email, role) VALUES 
('agent1', 'agent@test.com', 'agent'),
('import_export1', 'import@test.com', 'import_export'),
('quality1', 'quality@test.com', 'quality_committee'),
('pricing1', 'pricing@test.com', 'pricing_committee'),
('admin1', 'admin@test.com', 'admin');
```

### 3. Test Workflow Creation
1. Create a new drug as an agent:
```javascript
POST /drugsUnderProcess
{
  "drugName": "Test Drug",
  "manufacturer": "Test Manufacturer",
  "userId": "agent1"
  // ... other drug fields
}
```

2. Verify workflow is created:
```javascript
GET /workflow/{drugId}
```

### 4. Test Step Completion
Complete step 5 as agent:
```javascript
POST /drugsUnderProcess/{drugId}/complete-step
{
  "stepNumber": 5,
  "comments": "Step 5 completed",
  "userId": "agent1"
}
```

### 5. Test Notifications
Check notifications for import/export user:
```javascript
GET /notifications?userId=import_export1&userRole=import_export
```

### 6. Test Approval Flow
Approve step 5 as import/export user:
```javascript
POST /workflow/{drugId}/approve-step
{
  "stepNumber": 5,
  "comments": "Approved for import/export review",
  "userId": "import_export1"
}
```

### 7. Test Role-Based Access
